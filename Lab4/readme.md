## Introduction ##

Unit 4 examines operating systems and how to navigate directories and files from the command line. It also looks at Python, a programming language that many see as the most user-friendly language and the best one for beginners to start with when they first pick up programming. Specifically, the unit looks at the difference between coding using either the shell or a file editor in the Python IDLE, and then explains how to start with a very basic introductory Python program. Finally, the unit explains all the different types of graphics and what the advantages of using each different image format.

### Python IDLE ###

When writing code in Python, you can use either the shell or a file editor in the Python IDLE. The shell gives commands in real-time one at a time while the editor allows you to edit your Python files within IDLE before running your complete program. The shell is usually used to write simple command line programs, while the editor is used for more complex programs.

#### Code Examples ####

1. A variable is a container for storing data values, and can be any letter or word such as **x** or **var**. The author uses spam, eggs, and bacon because of a comedy sketch from Monty Python because he just wanted to use a generic name that is often used in Python tutorials.

2. An assignment statement assigns a value to a variable. So when you enter **x = 5**, the variable **x** is given the value of 5.

3. A function is a block of organized, reusable code that is used to perform a single, related action. Each function name is followed by opening and closing parenthesis, such as in the **print() function**. If you have any parameters, they will be inside the parenthesis.

4. A common example of a data type includes a sequence of characters called a string (identified by a single quote such as in myName = 'Arshpreet Aulakh'). Two numerical types that are often used are **floats** and **ints**. An **int** is always a positive or negative whole number (such as 363 or -18) while a float is used to represent a decimal. Finally, a **bool** is a boolean so it will always be either true or false (such as x = false).

### Graphics ###

#### Raster vs. Vector Graphics ####

Raster graphics are composed of pixels while vector graphics are composed of paths. A raster image would lose quality when enlarged as zooming in makes each pixel more visible, while a vector image are rendered using a special form of geometry so changing the image's size does not make the quality worse. Raster images are more common, as they are used all over the web in forms such as jpg, gif, and png. Vector graphics, on the other hand, are more often used in professional design settings and when the images will later be applied onto a physical product.

#### Lossless vs. Lossy Compression ####

Lossless compression removes some data from the original file and saves the image with a reduced file size. Designers can customize how much data to disregard by modifying the image compression rate, and all of the original data can be recovered whenever the file is uncompressed again. Lossy compression, however, permanently removes data. Knowing which type of compression to use matters to developers because it affects how much space you have and whether you are willing to accept minor losses of a file's original quality. Lossy compression will allow you to save more space while lossless compression allows you to keep the file in its original state.

#### File Formats ####

Images can come in various different formats such as jpg, gif, and png files. Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) uses lossy compression to create smaller file sizes and allows designers to modify how much compression is to be used, resulting in better image quality (when used correctly) while the file size remains as small as possible. The disadvantage to using jpg is images are prone to "artificating", where you can see pixels and halos at certain parts, especially places where there is a sharp contrast between colors. Graphics Interchange Format (GIF) supports up to 8 bits per pixel and is the only format of the three listed here that allows for animated images. Portable Network Graphics (PNG), like gifs, is another bitmapped image format that uses lossless data compression and was created to replace GIFs. Its biggest advantage is that it supports a number of transparency options. 

Each of the formats are best used for different types of images, so it helpful to use the one that results in high quality and smaller file size. GIFs are best for logos or line drawings, as they have a limited color palette. JPEGs are best for images with gradients where GIFs are inappropriate, as JPGs are ideal for photos with subtle shifts in color and without contrast. Finally, PNGs work best for images with high contrast or fully or partially transparent images.

#### File Properties ####

1. I decided to use a door shape to mimic what the product would be used for, and used three layers to give it the illusion of a door with a doggy door that goes outside with text on top.
2. The file size is 748 KB and it opens with Google Chrome (or any other internet browser) although it would likely be better to open as a png or jpeg file.

## Conclusion ##

Python was the first programming language I ever started coding on, so it was very interesting for me to start back with it after a few years. Operating on the command line, however, has always been a difficult process for me. Using Git to push my code onto Github is something I still struggle with, and doing basic tasks on the command line is a good way to become more comfortable using the terminal in general. Finally, understanding the difference between the different image formats, compressions, and graphics would be a great help if I do any design work or HTML/CSS in the future.
