# Executive Summary

This unit covers various types of software, virtualization, basics of Python, and explores different career options in information technology. Doing very basic tasks in Python reinforced how much more user-friendly it is when compared to Java, especially in terms of the syntax’s simplicity. Learning about the similarities and differences of cloud computing versus virtualization as well as the basics of operating systems and applications is sure to help me conceptualize my work as I go further in the field.

## Software

The two major types of software are operating systems and applications. The role of an operating system is to manage the hardware and create the interface between the hardware and the user, and to provide a platform for developers to write applications. Apple’s macOs is the operating system that all Apple users work with, while those with Windows use Microsoft Window’s OS, such as Windows 10 or Windows Vista.

Application software, on the other hand, is much more specific in its goal. You need application software for word processing, spreadsheets, or to use a browser for the Internet. Microsoft Office, is a comprehensive package that contains productivity software such as Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, and Microsoft Access.

Utility software is not as commonly used as operating systems and applications, but it does serve an important purpose. They allow you to fix or modify your computer in some way. They were created to fill shortcomings in operating systems. Some examples of utility software include anti-malware and recycle bins.

Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems were developed to bring together an entire organization within one program. It is used by an organization’s employees in an effort to edit and save their information from the same data source. Lawson and PeopleSoft are two of the most common ERPs used in healthcare to streamline and standardize everything for employees.

Virtualization is the process of using software to simulate a computer or some other device. It relies on software to simulate hardware functionality and create a virtual system, in order to run more than one virtual system and multiple operating systems and applications on a single server. This is done because it is both cost-effective and more efficient.

## Virtualization

Using multiple servers that each operate at a fraction of their capacity causes huge inefficiencies and excessive operating costs. To solve this problem, companies use a virtual machine (VM), an independent and self-contained tightly isolated software container with an OS and application inside. They enable several operating systems and applications to run on just one physical server called a **host**. A **hypervisor** decouples the VM from the host and dynamically allocates computing resources to each VM as needed.

Virtualization and cloud computing sound similar, but they are not interchangeable. Virtualization is the technology that allows cloud computing to exist as it replaces a physical machine with a virtual one. A virtual machine manipulates hardware while cloud computing is its own virtual environment that results from that manipulation. I see cloud computing as a natural progression of virtualization as it uses multiple computers to send data through wireless networks. A network administrator could move from virtualization to cloud computing by installing in the operating system of the host rather than directly on the hardware system. The administrator can use software to divide one physical server into multiple servers.

## Python

My first coding language I ever studied was Python, as I did lots of research to figure out which language is the best to learn first for complete beginners. Python was seen as the simplest object-oriented language that is also extremely powerful and effective. It has user-friendly syntax and dynamic typing, especially in contrast with Java, the language I have spent the most time using in my career up to this point. The **pseudo-code nature of Python** means that the language is not filled with confusing syntax or unnecessary steps. When I work with Java, I first use pseudocode to lay out what I am trying to accomplish with my code, in order to then focus on Java’s intricate syntax rules  to better troubleshoot any problems I may come across later. With Python, however, the simpler syntax rules make that extra step unnecessary. Everything is so similar to pseudocode, especially after becoming familiar with the language, that I can easily make out what I am doing directly in Python’s own syntax.

Another advantage of Python is it is an interpreted language instead of a compiled language. With compiled languages, one has to convert from the source language into binary using a compiler. With Python, however, you can just run the program directly from the source code. So Python programs are easily portable onto other computers because no compilers are needed.

## Career Exploration

I looked at the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ information regarding Software Developers to learn more about my career field. The median annual wage of developers is $107,000 per year, and job opportunities within the field are expected to grow 22% from 2019 to 2029. The page for computer programmers listed a median annual wage of $86,0000 with a 9% decline in opportunities until 2029. Based on a quick Google search, the two job titles are usually used interchangeably, but technically the difference between the two is that software developers are in charge of the entire software development process while computer programmers are responsible only for writing code.

#### College Central

College Central seems like a great resource to look for programming internships and junior developer positions. The website and application are both streamlined and search results are concise about what each company is looking for and how to send in your information. While I have been applying for jobs, I took advantage of this exercise to apply for internships as well. College Central allows you to build a career portfolio, attach your resume, and listen to career-related podcasts as well. I definitely anticipate taking advantage of this website to reach as many potential employers as possible.

#### Certifications

When I was first looking into the IT field, I was fascinated by cybersecurity and considered getting the CompTIA certification. It emphasizes security, automation, threat hunting, and IT regulator compliance. It is kept up-to-date as cybersecurity is a rapidly evolving field, and techniques for combating threats are always changing.

#### Certificates

I decided to take classes at Tri-C to get an Associate’s Degree (and possibly a Bachelor’s eventually as well) but I did strongly consider the IT-Programming and Development post-degree certificate. I have already taken most of the non-IT related classes required for the Associate’s degree, so it made sense to take an extra class or two in order to get that. The classes for both seem extremely interesting and they will undoubtedly help me on my path to becoming a successful software developer.

#### Co-ops/Internships

In order to pursue a Co-op position, one needs to be enrolled at Tri-C with at least 12 hours of college coursework and at least two courses related to IT with a GPA of 2.75 or higher. After this semester, I will have fulfilled these requirements. Internship requirements vary but from my searches, you usually need to be a sophomore in good standing to get an internship position. The major advantage of both is an opportunity to get your foot in the door of your desired field, network with potential mentors and employers, and learn from direct hands-on experience of what a job in programming would be like, whether it is something you would enjoy, and what you need to do in order to get better as a developer.

#### Industry Associations/Student Organizations

The Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition’s mission is to provide institutions with an information assurance or computer security curriculum a controlled, competitive environment to assess students’ depth of understanding and operational competency. CCDC events would be helpful by providing an educational venue in which students are able to apply theoretical and practical skills learned throughout classes, foster a spirit of teamwork and positive communication, and create interest among peers and institutions.


# Conclusion

Although I was already familiar with Python and the basics of software types, unit three’s concentration on virtualization was incredibly important as a concept. I have already used virtual machines but did not quite understand how they worked and what the advantages of one are while learning programming. Exploring different career options was also interesting, as I did not spend much time looking at internships before this unit. The College Central website as well as the different certifications available provided some great ways to get my foot into the door and become a more competitive applicant in the future.
